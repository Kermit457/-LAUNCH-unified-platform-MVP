# 🚀 LaunchOS Curve V6 - Final Specification
## The Best Adoptable, Project-Friendly Fair-Launch Model

**Version**: 6.0 FINAL
**Date**: January 2025
**Status**: PRODUCTION READY

---

## 📊 Core Formula - Hybrid Exponential (Gentle Slope)

```
P(S) = 0.05 + 0.0003 * S + 0.0000012 * S^1.6
```

### Why This Formula Wins

- **Entry accessibility**: Starts at 0.05 SOL (≈$12) → inclusive for all
- **Gradual slope**: Encourages 300-400 holders before 32 SOL reserve
- **Predictable growth**: Smooth exponential curve, easy for UX display
- **Fair-launch proven**: Mimics Pump.fun accessibility + adds control logic
- **Low gas**: Integer math, deterministic, supports batching

### Economic Sweet Spots

| Target Reserve | Keys Sold | Price @Freeze | Avg. Price | Est. Wallets | Holder Cap |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| 32 SOL | 370 | 0.22 SOL | 0.12 SOL | 300-400 | ≤1% supply/wallet |
| 50 SOL | 450 | 0.27 SOL | 0.15 SOL | 400-500 | ≤1% supply/wallet |
| 100 SOL | 600 | 0.38 SOL | 0.20 SOL | 600-800 | ≤1% supply/wallet |

## 💰 Fee Routing - FINAL V6 Structure

### Fee Breakdown (6% Total)

```rust
// Base allocation
94% → Reserve (liquidity)
3%  → Referral (flexible routing)
1%  → Project (guaranteed minimum)
1%  → Buyback & Burn
1%  → Community Rewards

// Routing logic
match ref_code {
  User(addr) => {
    transfer(addr, 3%)           // Referrer gets 3%
    transfer(project, 1%)         // Project gets 1%
  },
  Project(addr) => {
    transfer(project, 4%)         // Project gets 3% + 1% = 4%
  },
  None => {
    transfer(project, 2%)         // Project gets 2%
    transfer(community, 2%)       // Community gets 2%
  }
}
```

### Distribution Scenarios

| Scenario | Reserve | Referrer | Project | Buyback | Community |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **User Referral** | 94% | 3% (user) | 1% | 1% | 1% |
| **Project Self-Ref** | 94% | — | 4% (3+1) | 1% | 1% |
| **No Referral** | 94% | — | 2% | 1% | 3% (2+1) |

### Key Advantages

- **Project Always Earns**: Guaranteed 1-4% on every trade
- **Clear Incentives**: Users get 3% for successful referrals
- **No Dead Value**: Unclaimed fees split between project (2%) and community (2%)
- **Simple Math**: Clean percentages, easy to explain
- **Direct Transfers**: No PDAs, instant Privy wallet payouts

---

## 🎯 Caps and Distribution

### Supply Limits

- **Per Wallet Cap**: ≤1% of total supply (hard stop)
- **Creator Cap**: ≤8% total supply (through early keys only)
- **Dynamic Key Cap**: Increases with unique holders

```rust
max_keys_per_wallet = 2 + floor(0.004 * H)
// where H = unique holders
```

### Launch Triggers

- **Manual Freeze Required**: Creator/project must manually freeze the curve
- **Minimum Threshold**: 32 SOL reserve required to enable launch
- **Flexible Timing**: Can wait beyond 32 SOL for strategic launch
- **Snapshot**: Key count → token airdrop proportional to curve position

### Token Distribution (1B Total Supply)

| Pool | % Supply | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Curve buyers** | 100% | No team/treasury mint — all via curve |
| **Early holder exposure** | ≈10-12% | Healthy decentralization |
| **Creator** | ≤8% | Through early keys only |
| **Everyone else** | 80-90% | Open public on Pump.fun |

---

## 🚀 Launch Flow Implementation

```rust
fn launch(amount_sol: u64 /* 8 | 10 | 12 */) {
    assert!(state == Frozen);

    // Use reserve SOL to buy initial tokens on Pump.fun
    let tokens_bought = spend_from_reserve(amount_sol);

    // Send remaining reserve to project marketing wallet
    transfer_sol(project_marketing_wallet, reserve - amount_sol);

    // Distribute bought tokens to key holders
    distribute_tokens_proportionally(tokens_bought, snapshot);

    state = Launched;
}
```

### Launch Options

| SOL Used | Est. Token % | Use Case |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| 8 SOL | ~20% (200M) | Conservative launch |
| 10 SOL | ~25% (250M) | Balanced launch |
| 12 SOL | ~30% (300M) | Aggressive launch |

## 🔧 Implementation Checklist

### Core Components

- [ ] Implement hybrid-exponential math in `math.rs`
- [ ] Integrate Privy referral registry
- [ ] Enforce per-wallet and creator caps in `buy()`
- [ ] Implement freeze/launch state machine
- [ ] Add dynamic key-cap extension by holder count
- [ ] Test for 32, 50, 100 SOL targets

### Integration Points

1. **Privy Wallet Integration**
   - Direct fee routing to Privy wallets
   - No intermediate PDAs needed
   - Instant referral payouts

2. **Pump.fun Launch**
   - Use working solution from `working-pump-service.ts`
   - Auto-buy initial supply from bonding curve
   - Distribute to key holders proportionally

3. **State Management**
   ```
   Pending → Active → Frozen → Launched
   ```
