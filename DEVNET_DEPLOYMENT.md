## ✅ What's Working

1. **Smart Contract Deployed** - Live on devnet
2. **Program ID Updated** - In contract and .env
3. **Network Configured** - Switched to devnet
4. **Privy Auth** - Working with valid app ID
5. **Build System** - Compiles successfully

## 🔧 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today):
1. [x] Deploy contract to devnet
2. [ ] Test curve creation on devnet
3. [ ] Replace Pump.fun mocks with real SDK
4. [ ] Test full flow: Create → Trade → Freeze → Launch

### Tomorrow:
1. [ ] Update contract to V6 fee structure
2. [ ] Redeploy with V6 updates
3. [ ] Connect frontend to devnet contract
4. [ ] Test with real wallets

### Before Mainnet:
1. [ ] Complete V6 fee implementation
2. [ ] Security audit
3. [ ] Load testing
4. [ ] Deploy to mainnet-beta

## 🧪 Testing the Contract

### Create a Curve
```javascript
// Use the deployed program ID
const PROGRAM_ID = "Ej8XrDazXPSRFebCYhycbV1LZGdLHCFddRufRMqZUXQF";

// Create curve instruction
const createCurve = await program.methods
  .createCurve("twitter_handle", targetReserve, launchTs)
  .accounts({
    curve: curveKeypair.publicKey,
    creator: wallet.publicKey,
    // ... other accounts
  })
  .rpc();
```

### Test URLs
- **Explorer:** https://explorer.solana.com/address/Ej8XrDazXPSRFebCYhycbV1LZGdLHCFddRufRMqZUXQF?cluster=devnet
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3000 (with devnet network)

## 📝 Notes

- Contract is currently V4 fees, needs update to V6
- Devnet deployment for testing only
- Mainnet deployment requires fee structure update first
- All tests should use devnet RPC

## 🎉 Milestone Achieved!

LaunchOS smart contract is now **LIVE ON DEVNET**!

This is a huge step - we have a real, deployed Solana program that can:
- Create bonding curves
- Handle buy/sell operations
- Freeze curves
- Take snapshots
- Launch tokens

Next: Test it and integrate with Pump.fun!
