---

## ⏳ Phase 3: API & Integration (Pending)

### API Endpoints Needed
```
/api/curve/[id]/
  - GET    - Fetch curve data
  - POST   /buy - Execute buy order
  - POST   /sell - Execute sell order
  - POST   /freeze - Freeze trading
  - POST   /snapshot - Create snapshot
  - POST   /launch - Launch token
  - GET    /holders - Get holders list
  - GET    /chart - Get price chart data
```

### Pages Integration
- [ ] **/overview** - Dashboard widgets
- [ ] **/discover** - Unified curve feed
- [ ] **/u/[handle]** - Creator profile with curve
- [ ] **/p/[slug]** - Project page with curve

---

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Fee Model (94-3-2-1)
```typescript
Every buy transaction:
├─ 94% → Reserve (bonding curve)
├─ 3%  → Project wallet
├─ 2%  → Platform wallet
└─ 1%  → Referrer (or Rewards Pool)
```

### Bonding Curve Formula
```
Linear Curve:
├─ Price = 0.01 + (supply * 0.0001)
├─ Start: $0.01
└─ Growth: $0.0001 per key

Buy Cost = ∫(basePrice + supply * slope) ds
Sell Proceeds = Buy Cost * 0.95 (5% sell tax)
```

### State Machine
```
active → Can trade freely
  ↓
frozen → Trading disabled, preparing snapshot
  ↓
launched → Token created, LP added, keys airdropped
  ↓
utility → (Optional) Fees route to token buybacks
```

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Collections in Appwrite
```bash
npm run setup-curves
```

This creates all 4 collections with proper indexes and permissions.

### 2. Environment Variables
Already configured in `.env`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_CURVES_COLLECTION_ID=curves
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_CURVE_EVENTS_COLLECTION_ID=curve_events
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_CURVE_HOLDERS_COLLECTION_ID=curve_holders
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_SNAPSHOTS_COLLECTION_ID=snapshots
```

### 3. User Onboarding Flow
When user connects wallet:
```typescript
1. Check if user.curveId exists
2. If not, CurveService.createCurve({
     ownerType: 'user',
     ownerId: user.id
   })
3. Update user.curveId with new curve ID
4. Show "Buy Creator Key" CTA
```

## 🧪 Testing Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Bonding math calculations
- [ ] Fee split accuracy
- [ ] P&L tracking
- [ ] Holder balance updates

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Buy transaction flow
- [ ] Sell transaction flow
- [ ] Freeze → Snapshot → Launch
- [ ] Referral fee routing

### E2E Tests
- [ ] User creates curve on signup
- [ ] Another user buys keys
- [ ] Holder sees position
- [ ] Owner launches token
- [ ] LP created, tokens airdropped

---

## 📈 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ Run `npm run setup-curves` to create collections
2. 🔨 Build TradePanel component
3. 🔨 Create curve API endpoints
4. 🔨 Build LaunchWidget component

### Short-term (This Week)
5. Wire curves into /u/[handle] profiles
6. Add curve initialization on user signup
7. Build HoldersTable component
8. Create overview dashboard widgets

### Medium-term (Next Week)
9. Integrate with referral system
10. Add chart visualizations
11. Build project curves
12. Create unified /discover feed

### Long-term (Future)
13. Solana program integration
14. Real token launches via Pump.fun
15. LP management
16. Automated buybacks

---

## 🔗 Integration with Referral System

The curve system is **designed to work seamlessly** with the existing referral system:

```typescript
On every buy:
1. Calculate 1% referral fee
2. Check if buyer has referrer (from referral system)
3. If yes → credit referrer's rewards
4. If no → add to global rewards pool
5. Create referral event for tracking
```

**Referral Collections Already Created:**
- ✅ referrals
- ✅ referral_rewards
- ✅ rewards_pools

**Integration Points:**
- `CurveEventService.createEvent()` → `ReferralService.trackReferral()`
- `TradePanel` → checks `useReferralTracking()` for referrer
- `RewardsPanel` → shows curve trading rewards

---

## 💰 Revenue Streams

### For Platform
- 2% of all curve trades
- Potential LP fees from launched tokens
- Premium features (custom curves, analytics)

### For Creators
- 3% of their curve trades
- Ability to launch own token
- Community building via key holders

### For Users
- 1% referral fees
- Trading profits from curve speculation
- Early access to launched tokens

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Principles

### Color Coding
- **Active** = Purple glow (tradeable)
- **Frozen** = Amber (preparing launch)
- **Launched** = Green (token live)
- **Utility** = Blue (buyback mode)

### Component Hierarchy
```
CurveCard (Summary)
  ├─ TradePanel (Buy/Sell)
  ├─ HoldersTable (Top Supporters)
  ├─ LaunchWidget (Owner Controls)
  └─ CurveChart (Price History)
```

### Responsive Design
- Desktop: Full stats + charts
- Mobile: Compact cards + drawer modals
- All components support both variants

---

## 📝 Code Quality

### Type Safety
- 100% TypeScript
- No `any` types
- Strict null checks
- Comprehensive interfaces

### Error Handling
- Try-catch in all service methods
- Graceful fallbacks
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging

### Performance
- Optimistic UI updates
- Cached curve data
- Indexed database queries
- Lazy-loaded components

---

## 🚨 Known Limitations (Mock Phase)

1. **No Real Blockchain** - All trades are database records
2. **No Actual Tokens** - Token minting is simulated
3. **No LP** - Liquidity pool is conceptual
4. **Instant Execution** - No pending states/confirmations

These will be addressed in the **Solana Integration Phase**.
