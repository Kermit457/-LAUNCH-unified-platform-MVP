# Slippage Removal - Complete

## Summary

Successfully removed all user-facing slippage controls from the curve trading system, per user feedback that "slippage doesn't make sense for bonding curves."

## Rationale (User Feedback)

**Why slippage isn't needed for bonding curves:**
- **Deterministic pricing**: Price is calculated from formula (basePrice + supply × slope), not AMM pool ratios
- **No external volatility**: No MEV, no sandwich attacks, no pool ratio changes
- **Predictable quotes**: User always gets exactly what the curve formula predicts
- **Better UX**: Cleaner interface, less confusion, more user trust
- **Price Impact suffices**: Show deterministic price impact from curve instead

## Changes Made

### 1. API Routes

**app/api/curve/[id]/buy/route.ts**
- ✅ Removed slippage guard that was blocking trades
- ✅ Now shows price impact (deterministic from curve) as info only
- ✅ No hard limit on price changes

**app/api/curve/[id]/launch/route.ts**
- ✅ Removed `slippageBps` parameter from request body
- ✅ Removed slippage validation (was checking max 500 bps)
- ✅ LP seeding now uses fixed internal slippage: `slippageBps: 100` (1% for operations only)
- ✅ This internal value is NOT user-facing

### 2. React Components

**components/curve/LaunchOneClick.tsx**
- ✅ Removed slippage input field from modal
- ✅ Updated interface: `onLaunch?: (p0: number) => Promise<void>`
- ✅ Removed slippage state management
- ✅ Modal now only shows P0 (initial LP price) input
- ✅ Added note: "Current curve price: X SOL (deterministic from bonding curve)"

**components/curve/EntityCurveSection.tsx**
- ✅ Updated launch callback to remove slippage parameter
- ✅ Now calls: `await launch(p0)` instead of `await launch(p0, slippageBps)`

### 3. Hooks

**hooks/useCurve.ts**
- ✅ Updated launch signature: `launch: (p0?: number) => Promise<void>`
- ✅ Removed slippageBps parameter from API call body
- ✅ Now sends: `{ userId, p0 }` instead of `{ userId, p0, slippageBps }`

## What Remains

**Internal use only (NOT user-facing):**
- `lib/pump-fun/service.ts` - Pump.fun service accepts `slippageBps` for LP operations
- This is called by the launch route with a fixed value: `slippageBps: 100` (1%)
- This is a technical parameter for Solana LP transactions, not user-controlled

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Buy keys with various amounts - should show "Price Impact: X%" (not slippage error)
- [ ] Launch modal - should only show P0 input (no slippage field)
- [ ] Launch flow - should complete without slippage validation errors
- [ ] Verify deterministic pricing - same keys input always gives same SOL cost

## User Experience Improvements

**Before:**
- "Slippage too high: 2.00%. Max allowed: 0.5%" - confusing error
- Users had to understand slippage (irrelevant concept for bonding curves)
- Launch modal had confusing slippage input

**After:**
- Price impact shown as informational (deterministic from curve)
- Clean launch modal with just P0 (initial LP price)
- No confusing errors about slippage
- More trust - users know exactly what they'll pay

## Key Quote from User

> "In a bonding curve, price is deterministic (formula-based), not dependent on pool ratios or external trades. No AMM volatility, predictable quote, user trust, cleaner UX."
