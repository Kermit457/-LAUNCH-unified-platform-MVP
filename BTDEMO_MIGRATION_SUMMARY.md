## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK Areas
1. **UnifiedCard refactor** - Used in 10+ locations
   - Mitigation: Feature flag, backward compatibility
   - Rollback: Single component revert

2. **MotionScoreDisplay changes** - Visual breaking change
   - Mitigation: Extensive visual regression testing
   - Rollback: Keep old component in parallel

### MEDIUM RISK Areas
3. **Color migration** - Could break dark mode
   - Mitigation: Automated script + manual review
   - Rollback: Revert CSS variables

4. **Icon replacement** - Layout shifts possible
   - Mitigation: Size/spacing audit
   - Rollback: Simple import swap back to Lucide

### LOW RISK Areas
5. **LED font application** - Non-breaking addition
6. **Glass effect standardization** - Purely visual
7. **New component extraction** - Additive only

**Overall Risk**: **MEDIUM**
**Rollback Time**: <15 minutes for full rollback
