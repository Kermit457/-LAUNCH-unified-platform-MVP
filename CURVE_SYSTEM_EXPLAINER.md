# 🚀 LaunchOS Bonding Curve System - Team Explainer

## What Is This?

A **bonding curve trading system** that allows creators and projects to launch tradeable "keys" (shares) that can eventually be converted into real tokens on Solana.

Think: **friend.tech meets Pump.fun** - but for creators AND projects on LaunchOS.

---

## 🎯 Why We Built This

### The Problem
- Creators need ways to monetize their community before they have a token
- Projects need early funding and community building
- Users want early access to promising creators/projects
- Everyone wants fair, transparent pricing

### The Solution
**Bonding Curves**: Algorithmic pricing where:
- Price increases automatically as more people buy
- No manipulation, no rug pulls
- Early supporters get the best prices
- Automatic token launch when thresholds are met

---

## 💰 How It Works (User Perspective)

### For Creators/Projects (Sellers)

1. **Automatic Curve Creation**
   - When you join LaunchOS, a curve is created for you
   - You automatically own the first key (Key #1)
   - Your starting price: **0.01 SOL**

2. **Earn From Every Trade**
   - Someone buys your keys? You get **3% of the purchase**
   - Trade volume = $10,000? You earned $300 instantly
   - No setup needed - it's automatic

3. **Launch Your Token (Optional)**
   - Hit 100 keys + 4 holders + 10 SOL in reserve
   - Click "Launch Token"
   - Your keys become real tokens on Solana
   - Liquidity pool is automatically created
   - All key holders get airdropped tokens (proportional to their keys)

### For Buyers (Supporters)

1. **Discover & Buy Keys**
   - Browse creators/projects on LaunchOS
   - Buy their keys using SOL
   - Price increases with each purchase (bonding curve math)

2. **Trade Anytime**
   - **Sell** your keys back for SOL (5% tax to discourage dumping)
   - **Hold** for token launch (get airdropped tokens)
   - **Profit** from price appreciation

3. **Token Launch Benefits**
   - When creator launches token, you automatically get tokens
   - Amount = your keys × 1,000,000 tokens per key
   - Example: Hold 10 keys → Get 10M tokens

## 📊 The Math (Bonding Curve Formula)

### Linear Bonding Curve
```
Price = Base Price + (Current Supply × Slope)
Price = 0.01 + (supply × 0.0001)
```

### Real Examples

| Keys Sold | Current Price | Cost to Buy 1 More Key |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|
| 1         | 0.0101 SOL    | ~0.0101 SOL           |
| 50        | 0.015 SOL     | ~0.0151 SOL           |
| 100       | 0.020 SOL     | ~0.0201 SOL           |
| 500       | 0.060 SOL     | ~0.0601 SOL           |
| 1000      | 0.110 SOL     | ~0.1101 SOL           |

**Why this works:**
- Early buyers get cheap prices (0.01 SOL)
- As demand grows, price increases automatically
- No human manipulation possible
- Price is always deterministic (no surprises)

---

## 💵 Fee Distribution (Every Buy Transaction)

Every time someone buys keys, the SOL is split:

```
Total Cost = 100 SOL (example)

├─ 94 SOL → Reserve (bonding curve liquidity)
├─ 3 SOL  → Creator/Project wallet (instant revenue)
├─ 2 SOL  → Platform wallet (LaunchOS revenue)
└─ 1 SOL  → Referrer (or Rewards Pool if no referrer)
```

### Why This Split?

1. **94% Reserve**: Backs the bonding curve, used for token launch LP
2. **3% Creator Fee**: Instant monetization for creators
3. **2% Platform Fee**: Sustains LaunchOS development
4. **1% Referral**: Incentivizes sharing and growth

---

## 🔄 The Lifecycle (State Machine)

### State 1: Active (Trading)
```
✅ Anyone can buy keys
✅ Holders can sell keys (5% tax)
✅ Price increases with supply
✅ Reserve grows with each buy
```

### State 2: Frozen (Preparing Launch)
```
🔒 Owner freezes trading
🔒 No more buys/sells allowed
🔒 Snapshot of all holders taken
🔒 Ready for token creation
```

### State 3: Launched (Token Live)
```
🚀 SPL token created on Solana
🚀 Liquidity pool seeded with reserve
🚀 All key holders airdropped tokens
🚀 Trading moves to DEX (Raydium/Jupiter)
```

### State 4: Utility (Optional Future)
```
♻️ Curve becomes buyback mechanism
♻️ Trading fees buy back tokens from market
♻️ Tokens burned or redistributed
```

## 🎮 Demo Flow (What Your Team Can Test)

### Step 1: Visit Demo Page
```
http://localhost:3000/curve-demo
```

### Step 2: Buy Keys
- User: `demo-user-123`
- Balance: `100 SOL` (mock)
- Try buying 10 keys → Watch price increase
- Try buying 50 more → Price increases more

### Step 3: Check Stats
- Total supply increases
- Reserve grows (94% of each buy)
- Market cap updates
- Holder count updates

### Step 4: Sell Some Keys
- Sell 5 keys
- Notice: You get back SOL minus 5% tax
- Price decreases slightly (inverse of buy curve)

### Step 5: Launch Token (When Ready)
**Requirements:**
- ✅ 100+ keys in supply
- ✅ 4+ unique holders
- ✅ 10+ SOL in reserve

**What Happens:**
1. Freeze curve (no more trading)
2. Snapshot all holders and balances
3. Create SPL token on Solana (mocked for now)
4. Seed liquidity pool with reserve SOL
5. Airdrop tokens to all holders (1M tokens per key)
6. Update curve state to "launched"

## 🔐 Security & Safety

### What We Have
✅ Server-side validation (all trades verified on backend)
✅ State machine prevents invalid transitions
✅ Owner-only controls for freeze/launch
✅ Sell tax (5%) discourages pump & dump
✅ Launch thresholds prevent premature launches
✅ Rollback logic if launch fails

### What's Mocked (For Demo)
⚠️ Solana transactions (no real blockchain calls yet)

## 📈 Business Model

### Revenue for LaunchOS (2% of all trades)

**Example Scenarios:**

| Daily Volume | 2% Platform Fee | Monthly Revenue |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| $10,000      | $200/day        | $6,000/mo       |
| $100,000     | $2,000/day      | $60,000/mo      |
| $1,000,000   | $20,000/day     | $600,000/mo     |

### Revenue for Creators (3% of their curve trades)

**Example Creator:**
- 100 people buy keys
- Average purchase: $50
- Total volume: $5,000
- Creator earns: $150 instantly

**Scaling:**
- 1,000 key holders @ $50 avg = $1,500 earned
- 10,000 key holders @ $50 avg = $15,000 earned

### Value for Users
- Early access to promising creators/projects
- Fair price discovery (no manipulation)
- Potential upside from holding keys
- Token airdrops when launched

## 🚨 What to Test

### Critical Flows
1. **Buy Flow**
   - User buys keys → price increases ✅
   - Reserve grows by 94% ✅
   - Creator gets 3% ✅
   - Platform gets 2% ✅
   - Referrer gets 1% (if applicable) ✅

2. **Sell Flow**
   - User sells keys → gets SOL minus 5% ✅
   - Supply decreases ✅
   - Price decreases ✅
   - Holder count updates if user exits ✅

3. **Launch Flow**
   - Thresholds enforced (100 keys, 4 holders, 10 SOL) ✅
   - Freeze → Snapshot → Token → LP → Airdrop → Finalize ✅
   - Rollback on failure ✅
   - All holders airdropped proportionally ✅

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Buy with insufficient balance
- [ ] Sell more keys than owned
- [ ] Non-owner tries to launch
- [ ] Launch before thresholds met
- [ ] Multiple rapid buys (race conditions)

## 🎓 Key Concepts Your Team Should Understand

### 1. Bonding Curves (vs AMMs)
**AMM (Uniswap-style):**
- Price = ratio of token A / token B in pool
- Volatile (depends on pool balances)
- Subject to MEV attacks
- Needs slippage protection

**Bonding Curve (Our System):**
- Price = mathematical formula
- Deterministic (always predictable)
- No MEV risk
- No slippage needed

### 2. Why No Slippage?
In traditional DEXes, price can change between quote and execution (sandwich attacks, frontrunning).

With bonding curves, price is **guaranteed** by the formula. What you see is exactly what you get.

### 3. Why 5% Sell Tax?
Prevents "pump and dump" behavior:
- Buying? No tax (encourages support)
- Selling? 5% tax (discourages dumping)
- Creates slight asymmetry that favors holders

### 4. Launch Thresholds (Why They Exist)
- **100 keys minimum**: Ensures meaningful trading activity
- **4 holders minimum**: Prevents one person owning everything
- **10 SOL reserve**: Ensures viable liquidity for DEX pool

## 📞 Questions Your Team Might Ask

### Q: "Why not just use Pump.fun directly?"
**A:** Pump.fun is for token launches. We want:
- Pre-token trading (keys)
- Monetization before launch
- Integration with LaunchOS platform
- Multi-entity support (users AND projects)

### Q: "What if someone manipulates the price?"
**A:** They can't! Price is deterministic. The only way to raise price is to buy more keys (which costs them SOL and helps the creator).

### Q: "What prevents rug pulls?"
**A:**
- Reserve is locked in the contract
- Can only be used for token launch LP
- State machine prevents invalid transitions
- Launch requires minimum holders (fair distribution)

### Q: "Why 94-3-2-1 split?"
**A:**
- 94% → Reserve must be majority (backs the token launch)
- 3% → Creator fee (higher than platform, they deserve it)
- 2% → Platform fee (sustainable but fair)
- 1% → Referral (encourages viral growth)

### Q: "When will this be on mainnet?"
**A:** Need to:
1. Integrate real Solana SDK
2. Connect Pump.fun API
3. Add wallet signatures
4. Security audit
5. Beta testing with real SOL

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (depending on Pump.fun API access)

### Q: "How does this make money?"
**A:**
- **Platform**: 2% of every trade (recurring revenue)
- **Creators**: 3% of their curve trades (incentive to promote)
- **Potential**: Premium features (custom curves, analytics, early access)
