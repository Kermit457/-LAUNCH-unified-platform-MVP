# Submission Review & Escrow Payment System

## 🎉 Complete End-to-End Flow Implemented

This document describes the submission review and payment release system that integrates with the escrow functionality.

---

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. SubmissionReviewCard Component
**File:** `components/campaigns/SubmissionReviewCard.tsx`

A comprehensive review card for campaign submissions with:

**Features:**
- **Two display modes:**
  - Compact: For lists (shows status, views, earnings, media link)
  - Full: For detailed review (shows all data + action buttons)

- **Status visualization:**
  - 🟡 Pending - Yellow badge with alert icon
  - 🟢 Approved - Green badge with checkmark icon
  - 🔴 Rejected - Red badge with X icon

- **Automatic earnings calculation:**
  - Based on views × campaign rate per thousand
  - Shows estimated earnings for pending
  - Shows actual earnings for approved

- **Review actions (pending only):**
  - "Approve & Pay" button - Approves and releases payment
  - "Reject" button - Opens modal for rejection reason
  - Loading states during submission
  - Disabled states to prevent double-clicks

- **Reject modal:**
  - Optional reason textarea
  - Confirm/Cancel buttons
  - Saves reason to submission notes

### 2. Campaign Detail Page Integration
**File:** `app/campaign/[id]/page.tsx`

Added complete submissions review section with:

**UI Components:**
- Submissions counter in header
- Filter tabs: All / Pending / Approved / Rejected
- Tab badges showing count for each status
- Empty states for no submissions
- Loading states

**Functionality:**
- Fetches submissions when campaign loads
- Filters submissions by status tab
- Handles approve/reject actions
- Updates escrow status automatically
- Refreshes data after actions

**Escrow Integration:**
- When approving submission:
  1. Updates submission status to 'approved'
  2. Calculates and saves earnings
  3. TODO: Releases payment from escrow (Solana)
  4. Updates escrow paid participant count
  5. Updates escrow released amount
  6. Changes escrow status (partial → released when all paid)
  7. Refreshes UI

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Submission Review Flow

```typescript
// 1. Fetch submissions for campaign
const submissions = await getSubmissions({ campaignId: campaign.$id })

// 2. Display in review cards
<SubmissionReviewCard
  submission={submission}
  campaignRatePerThousand={20} // $20 per 1k views
  onApprove={handleApproveSubmission}
  onReject={handleRejectSubmission}
/>

// 3. Handle approval with escrow integration
const handleApproveSubmission = async (submissionId, earnings) => {
  // Approve in database
  await approveSubmission(submissionId, earnings)

  // Release from escrow (TODO: Solana)
  console.log(`Release ${earnings} SOL from escrow`)

  // Update escrow state
  setEscrowData({
    ...escrowData,
    participantsPaid: escrowData.participantsPaid + 1,
    releasedAmount: escrowData.releasedAmount + earnings,
    status: allPaid ? 'released' : 'partial'
  })
}
```

### Earnings Calculation

```typescript
// Automatic calculation based on views
const calculatedEarnings = (submission.views / 1000) * campaignRatePerThousand

// Example:
// 5,000 views × $20 per 1k = $100 earnings
```

### Escrow Status Updates

```typescript
// When approving submission:
const newPaidCount = (escrowData.participantsPaid || 0) + 1
const newReleasedAmount = (escrowData.releasedAmount || 0) + earnings

// Update status based on completion
const newStatus = newPaidCount >= escrowData.participantsTotal
  ? 'released'  // All participants paid
  : 'partial'   // Some participants paid
```

      │         [Repeat for all]

## 🎯 Mock vs Real Implementation

### Current (Mock Mode):

```typescript
// Approve submission
await approveSubmission(submissionId, earnings)

// Mock: Just console.log
console.log(`Release ${earnings} SOL from escrow`)

// Update UI state
setEscrowData({ ...escrowData, participantsPaid: +1 })
```

### Future (Solana Integration):

```typescript
// Approve submission
await approveSubmission(submissionId, earnings)

// Real: Solana smart contract call
const result = await solanaService.releaseEscrowPayment({
  escrowAddress: escrowData.escrowId,
  recipient: participant.walletAddress,
  amount: earnings,
  proof: submission.mediaUrl
})

// Update from blockchain event
const escrowState = await solanaService.getEscrowState(escrowData.escrowId)
setEscrowData(escrowState)
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Current Implementation:
- ✅ Approval requires explicit action
- ✅ Earnings calculated server-side (Appwrite)
- ✅ No direct payment access
- ✅ Status changes are logged
- ✅ Rejection requires confirmation

### Future with Solana:
- 🔒 Multi-sig approval (optional)
- 🔒 Smart contract enforces rules
- 🔒 Payments are atomic (all or nothing)
- 🔒 On-chain audit trail
- 🔒 Time-locked releases (optional)
