# Entity Model Implementation - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Service Layer Updates

**Created new service:**
- ‚úÖ [`lib/appwrite/services/project-members.ts`](../lib/appwrite/services/project-members.ts) - Complete project membership management

**Updated existing services with entity scoping:**
- ‚úÖ [`lib/appwrite/services/campaigns.ts`](../lib/appwrite/services/campaigns.ts) - Added `ownerType` + `ownerId` fields
- ‚úÖ [`lib/appwrite/services/submissions.ts`](../lib/appwrite/services/submissions.ts) - Added `ownerType` + `ownerId` fields
- ‚úÖ [`lib/appwrite/services/activities.ts`](../lib/appwrite/services/activities.ts) - Added `contextType` + `contextId` fields
- ‚úÖ [`lib/appwrite/services/payouts.ts`](../lib/appwrite/services/payouts.ts) - Added `ownerType` + `ownerId` fields
- ‚úÖ [`lib/appwrite/services/launches.ts`](../lib/appwrite/services/launches.ts) - Fixed schema inconsistencies

### 2. TypeScript Interfaces

All interfaces now include entity scoping fields:

```typescript
// Campaign, Submission, Payout
{
  ownerType: 'user' | 'project'
  ownerId: string
}

// Activity
{
  contextType: 'user' | 'project'
  contextId: string
}

// ProjectMember (new)
{
  projectId: string
  userId: string
  role: 'owner' | 'member'
}
```

### 3. Dashboard Implementation

**Updated [`app/dashboard/page.tsx`](../app/dashboard/page.tsx):**
- ‚úÖ Entity-scoped data queries based on current mode
- ‚úÖ Switches between user and project data automatically
- ‚úÖ Proper dependency tracking (`[userId, mode, selectedProject]`)
- ‚úÖ Console logging for debugging

**Query behavior:**
```typescript
// User mode:
getCampaigns({ ownerType: 'user', ownerId: userId })

// Project mode:
getCampaigns({ ownerType: 'project', ownerId: projectId })
```

### 4. UI Components

**Updated [`components/dashboard/OverviewHeader.tsx`](../components/dashboard/OverviewHeader.tsx):**
- ‚úÖ Profile preview card with main avatar
- ‚úÖ Quick switcher bubbles for other entities
- ‚úÖ Fixed field mapping (`title || tokenName`, `logoUrl || tokenImage`)
- ‚úÖ Properly filters out current project from bubbles

### 5. Configuration

**Updated [`lib/appwrite/client.ts`](../lib/appwrite/client.ts):**
- ‚úÖ Added `PROJECT_MEMBERS` collection constant

## üìã Next Steps - Appwrite Console Setup

### Required: Database Schema Changes

Follow the instructions in [`APPWRITE_SETUP_STEPS.md`](./APPWRITE_SETUP_STEPS.md):

1. **Create `project_members` collection**
2. **Add entity scoping fields to existing collections:**
   - campaigns: `ownerType`, `ownerId`
   - submissions: `ownerType`, `ownerId`
   - activities: `contextType`, `contextId`
   - payouts: `ownerType`, `ownerId`

### Optional: Data Migration

If you have existing data, run migration scripts to populate:
- `project_members` entries for existing projects
- Default `ownerType='user'` and `ownerId=creatorId` for existing campaigns/submissions

---

## üîÑ How It Works Now

### User Mode
1. User logs in
2. Dashboard queries: `ownerType='user'`, `ownerId=userId`
3. Shows personal campaigns, earnings, submissions
4. Avatar bubbles show linked projects

### Project Mode
1. User clicks project bubble or dropdown
2. Dashboard queries: `ownerType='project'`, `ownerId=projectId`
3. Shows project-specific campaigns, earnings, submissions
4. Avatar bubble shows user account (for quick switch back)

### Data Separation
- **Before:** All queries filtered by `createdBy: userId` ‚Üí same data in both modes
- **After:** Queries filtered by `ownerType + ownerId` ‚Üí different data per entity

---

## üß™ Testing Guide

### Test Scenario 1: User Mode
1. Navigate to `/dashboard?mode=user`
2. Create a campaign
3. Check Appwrite: campaign should have `ownerType='user'`, `ownerId={your userId}`
4. Dashboard should show this campaign

### Test Scenario 2: Project Mode
1. Create a project in `/discover`
2. Click project bubble in dashboard header
3. Create a campaign in project mode
4. Check Appwrite: campaign should have `ownerType='project'`, `ownerId={projectId}`
5. Switch back to user mode ‚Üí campaign should NOT appear
6. Switch to project mode ‚Üí campaign SHOULD appear

### Test Scenario 3: Quick Switching
1. In user mode, click a project bubble ‚Üí should instantly switch
2. In project mode, click user bubble ‚Üí should switch back
3. Avatar should update to show current entity
4. KPI data should update to match current entity

---

## üìä Console Debugging

The dashboard logs useful information:

```
üìä Fetching dashboard data for user: {userId}
üìä Found: 5 campaigns, 10 submissions, 3 payouts

üìä Fetching dashboard data for project: {projectId}
üìä Found: 2 campaigns, 1 submissions, 0 payouts
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Legacy `createdBy` field still supported in getCampaigns()
- Old schema fields (`tokenName`, `tokenImage`) still work
- Gradual migration possible

### New Campaign Creation
When creating campaigns, YOU MUST SET:
```typescript
{
  ownerType: mode === 'project' ? 'project' : 'user',
  ownerId: mode === 'project' ? selectedProject.id : userId,
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Project Membership
When a user creates a project, MUST create project_member entry:
```typescript
await addProjectMember({
  projectId: newProject.$id,
  userId: userId,
  role: 'owner'
})
```

## üöÄ Features Now Possible

1. ‚úÖ **Project Dashboards** - Each project has its own analytics
2. ‚úÖ **Team Collaboration** - Multiple users can manage a project
3. ‚úÖ **Role-Based Access** - Owners vs Members (infrastructure ready)
4. ‚úÖ **Separate Economics** - Project earnings ‚â† User earnings
5. ‚úÖ **Entity Switching** - Quick toggle between user/project contexts

## üí° Key Concepts

**Entity** = User OR Project (both are first-class citizens)

**Owner** = Entity that owns the data (campaigns, submissions, etc.)

**Context** = Entity in which an activity/action happens

**Scope** = Filter used to query data for a specific entity

---

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Do I need to migrate existing data?**
A: Not immediately. The system works with empty scoping fields (queries won't filter). But for proper separation, yes, migrate data.

**Q: Can a campaign belong to both a user and a project?**
A: No. Each campaign has ONE owner (`ownerType` + `ownerId`). This ensures clean data separation.

**Q: How do I add members to a project?**
A: Use `addProjectMember(projectId, userId, 'member')`. This creates an entry in `project_members` collection.

**Q: Will old code break?**
A: No. Services still accept legacy parameters like `createdBy`. But they won't provide entity separation without `ownerType`/`ownerId`.

---

## üéØ Next Development Tasks

1. Update campaign creation modals to set `ownerType`/`ownerId`
2. Update submission creation to inherit owner from campaign
3. Create project member management UI
4. Implement role-based permissions checks
5. Add "Managed by" display in project mode header
6. Create project settings page
7. Add project invitation flow
