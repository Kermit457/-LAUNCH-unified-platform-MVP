## üèóÔ∏è Next Steps

### 1. Build the Program
```bash
cd solana-program
anchor build
```

### 2. Run Tests (Once Created)
```bash
anchor test
```

### 3. Deploy to Devnet
```bash
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

### 4. Initialize the Program
```typescript
await program.methods
  .initialize(
    platformTreasury,
    buybackWallet,
    communityWallet
  )
  .accounts({...})
  .rpc();
```

### 5. Create Your First Curve
```typescript
await program.methods
  .createCurve(
    "elonmusk",  // twitter handle
    { profile: {} },  // curve type
    null  // optional launch_ts for time-based freeze
  )
  .accounts({...})
  .rpc();
```

## üìù Known Limitations / TODOs

### For Production:
1. **Token Transfer in claim_tokens()** - Currently just records the claim. Need to add actual SPL token transfer once token mint is created.
2. **Pump.fun CPI** - Launch instruction emits event for off-chain service. Could be enhanced with direct Pump.fun CPI once SDK is integrated.
3. **Tests** - Need comprehensive test suite covering all scenarios.
4. **Off-chain Service** - Need service to listen for LaunchReadyEvent and handle Pump.fun token creation.

### Optional Enhancements:
- Add `update_snapshot_token_pool()` instruction to set total_token_pool after Pump.fun buy
- Add admin function to update target_reserve per curve
- Add ability to cancel/refund if launch fails
- Add time limit for claims (e.g., 90 days)
