# Solana Wallet Integration - Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ Configuration Complete

The critical fix has been applied to enable Solana wallets in Privy!

### What Was Fixed

**Updated [contexts/PrivyProviderWrapper.tsx](contexts/PrivyProviderWrapper.tsx)**:

```typescript
embeddedWallets: {
  createOnLogin: 'users-without-wallets',
  chains: ['ethereum', 'solana'],  // ‚úÖ CRITICAL: Solana must be declared here
}
```

**Why this matters**: Privy only provisions chains that are both:
1. ‚úÖ Enabled in your dashboard (done)
2. ‚úÖ Declared in your client config (now done!)

---

## Testing Steps

### 1. Restart the Dev Server

The config change requires a restart:

```powershell
.\restart-dev.ps1
```

Or manually:
```powershell
# Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm run dev
```

---

### 2. Open the Test Page

Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000/test-solana
```

---

### 3. Login with Privy

Click **"Login with Privy"** and authenticate with:
- Twitter (recommended)
- Email
- Or connect a wallet

---

### 4. What You Should See

After logging in, the test page will show:

#### ‚úÖ Authentication Status
```
Privy Status: Ready ‚úÖ
Authentication: Authenticated ‚úÖ
```

#### üéØ Solana Wallet Status (THE KEY SECTION)
```
Solana Connected: ‚úÖ Yes
Solana Address:
  [Your Solana wallet address - 44 characters starting with a letter]
  Example: 7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU
```

#### All Linked Accounts
You should see multiple accounts:
- **Type: twitter** (if you logged in with Twitter)
- **Type: wallet** with:
  - Wallet Client: `privy`
  - Chain Type: `solana` ‚úÖ
  - Address: [Your Solana address]
- **Type: wallet** with:
  - Wallet Client: `privy`
  - Chain Type: `ethereum`
  - Address: [Your EVM address]

---

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators

1. **"Solana Connected: ‚úÖ Yes"** in green
2. A valid Solana address displayed (44 characters, base58 encoded)
3. At least one wallet account with `Chain Type: solana` in the linked accounts list

### ‚ùå If Solana Wallet Doesn't Appear

If you see **"Solana Connected: ‚ùå No"**:

#### Quick Fixes:

1. **Logout and login again**:
   - Click the "Logout" button
   - Login again with the same method
   - Privy creates wallets asynchronously

2. **Try a fresh account**:
   - Use incognito mode
   - Login with a different Twitter account or email
   - New accounts trigger fresh wallet creation

3. **Check browser console**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for Privy-related messages or errors
   - Share any errors you see

4. **Verify the config loaded**:
   - Check the "All Linked Accounts" section
   - If you see NO wallet accounts at all, the config may not have loaded
   - Try restarting the dev server again

## Next Steps After Success

Once you see the Solana wallet address:

### 1. Use the Hook in Your Components

```typescript
import { useSolanaWallet } from '@/hooks/useSolanaWallet'

function MyComponent() {
  const { address, connected, publicKey } = useSolanaWallet()

  if (!connected) {
    return <p>Please connect your wallet</p>
  }

  return <p>Your Solana address: {address}</p>
}
```

### 2. Buy Keys Component

The `BuyKeysButton` component is ready to use:

```typescript
import { BuyKeysButton } from '@/components/BuyKeysButton'

function CurvePage() {
  return (
    <BuyKeysButton
      twitterHandle="elonmusk"
      amount={1}
      onSuccess={(sig) => console.log('Success:', sig)}
    />
  )
}
```

### 3. Display Curve Stats

```typescript
import { CurveStats } from '@/components/CurveStats'

function StatsPage() {
  return <CurveStats twitterHandle="elonmusk" />
}
```

---

## Debugging Tips

### Check Environment Variables

The test page shows:
- Network: devnet
- Curve Program: Ej8XrDazXPSRFebCYhycbV1LZGdLHCFddRufRMqZUXQF
- Privy App ID: cmfsej8w70...

If any show "Not Set", check your `.env` file.

### Privy Account Type

Your Privy dashboard shows:
- ‚úÖ Embedded wallets: ON
- ‚úÖ Solana wallets: Checked
- ‚úÖ Create for all users: Checked

This means every user who logs in should get a Solana wallet automatically.

### Wallet Creation Timing

Privy creates embedded wallets:
- **Immediately** for new users
- **Within 1-2 seconds** after login
- **Asynchronously** in the background

If you don't see it immediately, wait 5 seconds and refresh the page.
