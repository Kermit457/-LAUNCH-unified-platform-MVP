# üöÄ Vercel Deployment Guide

**Deploy LaunchOS to Vercel in ~15 minutes**

---

## ‚úÖ **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

Before deploying, make sure:

- [x] App runs locally (`npm run dev` works)
- [x] All real-time features working
- [x] Appwrite configured
- [x] Environment variables in `.env`
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors

---

## üìã **Step 1: Verify Local Build**

First, make sure the app builds successfully:

```bash
# In your project root
npm run build

# Should complete without errors
# If errors, fix them before deploying
```

---

## üîß **Step 2: Create vercel.json**

Create a `vercel.json` file in your project root for configuration.

**File:** `vercel.json`

```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "regions": ["iad1"],
  "env": {
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT": "@appwrite_endpoint",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID": "@appwrite_project_id",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID": "@appwrite_database_id",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID": "@privy_app_id"
  }
}
```

---

## üåç **Step 3: Install Vercel CLI (Optional)**

You can deploy via CLI or web dashboard. CLI is faster:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Follow the prompts
```

---

## üöÄ **Step 4A: Deploy via CLI (Recommended)**

```bash
# In your project root
cd "C:\Users\mirko\OneDrive\Desktop\WIDGETS FOR LAUNCH"

# First deployment (will ask questions)
vercel

# Answer the prompts:
# Set up and deploy? Yes
# Which scope? Your account
# Link to existing project? No
# Project name? launchos (or your choice)
# Directory? ./ (current directory)
# Override settings? No

# For production deployment
vercel --prod
```

---

## üåê **Step 4B: Deploy via Web Dashboard (Alternative)**

If you prefer the web interface:

1. **Go to** https://vercel.com
2. **Sign in** with GitHub/GitLab/Email
3. **Click** "Add New Project"
4. **Import** your GitHub repo (or upload folder)
5. **Configure:**
   - Framework Preset: **Next.js**
   - Root Directory: `./`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
6. **Add Environment Variables** (see Step 5)
7. **Click** "Deploy"

---

## üîê **Step 5: Environment Variables**

Add these in Vercel Dashboard:

**Go to:** Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

| Variable | Value | Where to Get |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT` | `https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1` | Your Appwrite console |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` | `68e34a030010f2321359` | Your Appwrite project |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID` | `launchos_db` | Your database ID |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID` | Your Privy app ID | https://privy.io |
| `APPWRITE_API_KEY` | Your API key | Appwrite ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API Keys |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_*_COLLECTION_ID` | Collection IDs | For each collection |

**All Collection IDs:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_LAUNCHES_COLLECTION_ID=launches
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_CAMPAIGNS_COLLECTION_ID=campaigns
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_QUESTS_COLLECTION_ID=quests
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_USERS_COLLECTION_ID=users

## üîç **Step 6: Update Appwrite CORS**

Add your Vercel URL to Appwrite allowed origins:

1. **Go to** Appwrite Console
2. **Navigate to** Settings ‚Üí Platforms
3. **Add Web Platform:**
   - Name: `LaunchOS Production`
   - Hostname: `your-app.vercel.app` (or custom domain)
4. **Click** "Add Platform"

---

## ‚úÖ **Step 7: Verify Deployment**

After deployment completes:

1. **Visit** your Vercel URL
2. **Test** these features:
   - ‚úÖ Homepage loads
   - ‚úÖ Sign in with Privy works
   - ‚úÖ Navigate to /discover
   - ‚úÖ Navigate to /network
   - ‚úÖ Navigate to /dashboard
   - ‚úÖ Real-time features work
   - ‚úÖ No console errors

## üêõ **Common Issues & Fixes**

### **Build Fails: "Module not found"**
```bash
# Check package.json has all dependencies
npm install

# Try building locally first
npm run build
```

### **Environment Variables Not Working**
- Make sure they're prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for client-side
- Redeploy after adding new env vars
- Check they're set for "Production" environment

### **Appwrite CORS Error**
- Add your Vercel domain to Appwrite platforms
- Format: `https://your-app.vercel.app` (no trailing slash)

### **TypeScript Errors**
```bash
# Fix TypeScript errors before deploying
npm run build

# Check for errors and fix them
```

### **Privy Not Working**
- Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID` is set
- Check Privy dashboard for allowed domains
- Add your Vercel URL to Privy allowed origins

## üé® **Step 8: Custom Domain (Optional)**

To use your own domain:

1. **Go to** Vercel Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
2. **Add** your domain (e.g., `launchos.app`)
3. **Configure DNS:**
   - Add CNAME record pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
   - Or A record to Vercel's IP
4. **Wait** for DNS propagation (5-10 minutes)
5. **Update** Appwrite CORS with new domain
