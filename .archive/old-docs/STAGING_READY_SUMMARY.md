  - Filter by type (ICM/CCM/MEME)
  - Filter by status (live/upcoming/frozen)
  - Sort by trending/volume/conviction/new
  - Search by title
  - User holdings calculation
- **Location**: [app/discover/page.tsx](app/discover/page.tsx)

### ✅ Profile Page
**Status**: Fully integrated with wallet + Appwrite

- **Real SOL balance** from Privy wallet via `useSolanaBalance()` hook
- **Real holdings calculation** from CURVE_HOLDERS collection
- **Real network stats** from NETWORK_INVITES collection
- **Profile save** wired to CREATE/UPDATE USER profile
- **Action buttons** implemented:
  - Save Profile → `updateUserProfile()`
  - Receive → Opens modal (UI pending)
  - Send → Opens modal (UI pending)
  - Share → Native share API
  - Export → Placeholder for CSV export

## 10. Deployment Steps

1. **Push to Git**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: complete Appwrite integration for staging"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel Auto-Deploy**
   - Vercel will detect push and auto-build
   - Monitor at: https://vercel.com/[username]/[project]

3. **Manual Deploy (Alternative)**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Post-Deploy Verification**
   - Check all environment variables loaded
   - Test key user flows
   - Monitor error logs in Vercel dashboard

## 11. Key Files Modified

### New Files Created
- `lib/appwrite/services/discover.ts`
- `lib/appwrite/services/dealflow.ts`
- `hooks/useCurveTrade.ts`
- `hooks/useSolanaBalance.ts`
- `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- `STAGING_READY_SUMMARY.md`

### Major Updates

---

## 12. Architecture Decisions

### Data Flow
```
User Action → Component Handler → Service Layer → Appwrite API → State Update → UI Refresh
```

### Service Layer Pattern
- All Appwrite interactions go through service files
- Services handle error logging and type transformation
- Components stay thin, focused on UI logic

### State Management
- React hooks for local state
- Appwrite for global/persistent state
- No Redux/Zustand needed (yet)

### Error Handling
- Try/catch in all async operations
- User-friendly toast messages
- Console logging for debugging

---

## 13. Performance Considerations

### Current Optimizations
- Listings fetched once per filter change
- Holdings calculated on profile load only
- Balance refreshes every 30 seconds
- Parallel data fetching where possible

### Future Optimizations
- Implement ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for listings
- Add caching layer (Redis/Vercel KV)
- Paginate listings (currently limit 50)
- Optimize image loading with Next.js Image

---

## 14. Security Measures

### Implemented
- ✅ Privy authentication required for all mutations
- ✅ User ID checks before database writes
- ✅ Appwrite collection-level permissions
- ✅ Input validation on all forms

### TODO for Production
- [ ] Rate limiting on API routes
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Content Security Policy headers
- [ ] Sanitize user-generated content

---

## 15. Monitoring & Observability

### Recommended Setup
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry
- **Analytics**: PostHog or Vercel Analytics
- **Logs**: Vercel Logs + Appwrite Logs
- **Uptime**: UptimeRobot

---

## ✅ Ready for Staging!

The application is ready for deployment to Vercel staging environment.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review [VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
2. Ensure all Appwrite collections are created
3. Configure environment variables in Vercel
4. Deploy and test!
