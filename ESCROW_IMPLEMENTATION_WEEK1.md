# 🏗️ Escrow Implementation - Week 1 Plan

**Goal:** Build and deploy the core escrow smart contract to devnet

---

## 📅 **Day-by-Day Breakdown**

### **Day 1-2: Environment Setup** ✅ (YOU ARE HERE)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Install Rust, Solana CLI, Anchor
- [ ] Create Solana devnet wallet
- [ ] Get devnet SOL from faucet
- [ ] Initialize Anchor project
- [ ] Verify `anchor build` works

**Deliverable:** Working development environment

---

### **Day 3-4: Smart Contract Core**

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Write escrow program (`lib.rs`)
- [ ] Define account structures (`state.rs`)
- [ ] Implement core functions:
  - `initialize()` - Create master escrow
  - `create_pool()` - Create sub-pool for specific use case
  - `deposit()` - Deposit USDC to pool
  - `withdraw()` - Withdraw USDC from pool
- [ ] Add error handling (`errors.rs`)

**Deliverable:** Complete smart contract code

---

### **Day 5: Testing**

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Write integration tests (`tests/launchos-escrow.ts`)
- [ ] Test all functions on local validator
- [ ] Fix bugs and edge cases
- [ ] Deploy to devnet

**Deliverable:** Tested and deployed contract on devnet

---

### **Day 6-7: TypeScript SDK**

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Build `EscrowManager` class
- [ ] Create helper functions
- [ ] Write React hooks
- [ ] Test SDK with devnet program

**Deliverable:** TypeScript SDK ready for UI integration

---

## 🎯 **Week 1 Success Criteria**

By end of Week 1, you should have:

✅ Solana program deployed to devnet
✅ Program ID generated and saved
✅ TypeScript SDK working
✅ Ability to create pools, deposit, and withdraw USDC (on devnet)
✅ All tests passing

---

## 📝 **Quick Start Commands**

### **Setup (Run Once)**
```bash
# Install everything
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.17.0/install)"
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked --force
avm install latest && avm use latest

# Configure Solana
solana config set --url devnet
solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/devnet.json
solana airdrop 2

# Initialize project
cd solana-program
anchor init launchos-escrow
```

### **Development (Daily)**
```bash
# Build the program
cd solana-program
anchor build

# Run tests
anchor test

# Deploy to devnet
anchor deploy

# Get program ID
solana address -k target/deploy/launchos_escrow-keypair.json
```

## 🧩 **What We're Building (Simplified v1)**

For Week 1, we'll build a **simple** version with core functionality:

### **Program Functions:**

1. **initialize()**
   - Creates the master escrow account
   - Sets admin authority
   - One-time setup

2. **create_pool(pool_type, pool_id)**
   - Creates a new escrow pool
   - Types: Boost, Campaign, Quest, Contribution
   - Each pool tracks balance separately

3. **deposit(pool_id, amount)**
   - User deposits USDC to specific pool
   - USDC held by program (escrow)
   - Emits deposit event

4. **withdraw(pool_id, recipient, amount)**
   - Admin-authorized withdrawal
   - Releases USDC from pool to recipient
   - Emits withdrawal event

### **Account Structure:**

```rust
// Master escrow account
pub struct MasterEscrow {
    pub authority: Pubkey,
    pub usdc_mint: Pubkey,
    pub total_pools: u64,
    pub bump: u8,
}

// Individual pool account
pub struct EscrowPool {
    pub pool_id: String,
    pub pool_type: PoolType,
    pub balance: u64,
    pub total_deposited: u64,
    pub total_withdrawn: u64,
    pub owner_id: Option<String>,
    pub status: PoolStatus,
    pub bump: u8,
}

pub enum PoolType {
    Boost,
    Campaign,
    Quest,
    Contribution,
    Revenue,
}

pub enum PoolStatus {
    Active,
    Closed,
}
```

## 🚫 **What We're NOT Building Yet**

Save these for Week 2-3:

- ❌ Automated payout distribution
- ❌ Multi-sig admin controls
- ❌ Time-locked withdrawals
- ❌ Refund logic for unclaimed funds
- ❌ Revenue split calculations
- ❌ Complex access control

**Keep it simple for v1!** Get core deposit/withdraw working first.
