## What's Left to Do (Optional)

### Replace Mock Data with Real Queries

For production deployment, replace mock data files with Appwrite queries:

1. **Dashboard** - `lib/dashboardMockData.ts`
   - Replace with `lib/appwrite/services/curves.ts`
   - Fetch user's actual holdings

2. **Discover Page** - `lib/unifiedMockData.ts`
   - Replace with `lib/appwrite/services/curves.ts`
   - Query all active curves

3. **Live Page** - `lib/livePitchMockData.ts`
   - Replace with `lib/appwrite/services/live-streams.ts`
   - Fetch real-time events

4. **Charts** - `lib/mockChartData.ts`
   - Replace with `lib/appwrite/services/price-history.ts`
   - Fetch actual price candles

**Reference:** All service implementations exist in `lib/appwrite/services/`

---

## Audit Tools Usage

### Run Health Check Anytime

```bash
node scripts/audit-codebase.mjs
```

This will:
- Scan all mock data files
- Check which are imported
- Generate `AUDIT_REPORT.csv`
- Show recommendations

### Archive Unused Files Safely

```bash
# Dry run (see what would happen)
node scripts/safe-archive.mjs

# Apply (actually move files)
APPLY=1 node scripts/safe-archive.mjs
```

Files are moved to `.archive/` instead of deleted - fully reversible.

## Rollback Plan

If you need to undo any cleanup:

### Restore from Git
```bash
git log --oneline -10          # Find cleanup commits
git revert <commit-hash>       # Undo specific cleanup
```

### Restore from Archive
```bash
# Copy back archived scripts
cp -r archive/scripts/* scripts/

# Or specific file
cp archive/scripts/test-launch.js scripts/
```

### Fresh Clone
```bash
git clone <repo-url> widgets-for-launch-backup
cd widgets-for-launch-backup
git checkout <commit-before-cleanup>
```

## Questions?

**Q: Can I delete .archive/ now?**
A: Wait 1-2 weeks to ensure nothing is needed, then yes.

**Q: What if I need a removed test file?**
A: Check `archive/scripts/` - everything is there.

**Q: How do I keep the codebase clean?**
A: Run `node scripts/audit-codebase.mjs` monthly.

**Q: Can I add back mock data?**
A: Yes, but prefer real Appwrite queries for production.
